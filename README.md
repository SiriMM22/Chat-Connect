# Chat_room
A Chat Application built using Pythonâ€™s socket module and threading. It allows multiple clients to connect, select nicknames, and communicate via a central server. Messages are broadcast to all clients, and the server handles new connections and disconnections. A practical demonstration of network communication and concurrent threading.
